# PEMDAS-Kotlin-CSE310

# Overview

This is a mobile app that I worked on in my first module, so I am building off of it. The original idea was creating a calculator that can function like a basic calculator. I called this calculator "PEMDAS" because of the listed order of opperations; I thought that was very fitting for a calculator app name lol.

I chose to write in the language Kotlin. I thought it would be very exciting for me to learn about this language and be able to put my practices to good use. The software that I chose to write this program in was Android Studio. This is my 2nd time using this software.
